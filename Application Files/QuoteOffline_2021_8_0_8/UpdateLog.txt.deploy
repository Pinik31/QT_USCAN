-------------VERSION 2021.3.0.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Dataaccess Changes
	- Many classes had had connection strings embeded in them.  All the same.  Moving this so a single connection string, where possible
	  covers this need.  Increases security and ease of configuration
2. UI Changes
	- Main window can now be resized
	- Password/Login box now recenters automatically
	- Password/Login box has proper TAB order to aid in login speed using keyboard
3. General Code Changes
	- Removed a TON of commented garbage code (see RemovedCode-SDV.txt)
	- Updated method and function calls to use .NET 4.5 standards instead of calls that were flagging as depreciated
	- Added comments to various functions including the MS standard "///" blocks so calling code members would be easier
